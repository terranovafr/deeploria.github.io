date: 2025-01-28
---
This session introduces Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their innovative approach to understanding complex graphs. 
Dive into the core concepts—from graph representations and message passing to pooling and cutting-edge attention mechanisms. 
Using PyTorch Geometric, you’ll gain practical experience building, training, and optimizing GNN models on real-world datasets spanning molecular structures, social networks, and beyond.
