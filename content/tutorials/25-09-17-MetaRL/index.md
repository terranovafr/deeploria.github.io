title: Meta-Reinforcement Learning - Boosting RL Generalization
date: 2025-01-30
---
Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error but often struggles to generalize to new situations. Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) addresses this limitation by leveraging prior experience to help agents adapt more quickly to novel tasks. This tutorial will cover the fundamentals of deep RL and meta-learning, including an introduction to MAML applied to RL. The hands-on session will use a grid environment to explore how policies trained on a single environment, with domain randomization, or via meta-learning respond to environmental perturbations.
