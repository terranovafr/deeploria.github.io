date: 2025-02-14
---

This session introduces meta-learning—'learning to learn'—which focuses on creating models that can quickly adapt to new tasks by leveraging prior knowledge. Participants will explore the fundamental concepts of meta-learning and examine key techniques such as optimization-based methods like MAML, metric-based approaches like Prototypical Networks, and model-based strategies like HyperNetworks. Additionally, the tutorial includes a hands-on session where attendees will use specialized libraries to implement and experiment with these meta-learning algorithms, providing practical experience in designing adaptive and efficient machine learning models.
